# MVC-Loan
Create a simple application that can be used to calculate the cost of a housing loan. 
	- The application should have a simple user interface where the user can specify the desired amount and the payback time in years. 
	- For simplicity we assume a fixed interest rate of 3.5% per year during the complete term of the loan. The interest should be linked to the loan type in such a way that different loan types can have different interest. 
	- When selecting amount and payback time, the application should generate a monthly payback plan based on the series loan principle, i.e. you pay back an equal amount each month and add the generated interest. The interest is calculated every month.

The application should be made in such a manner that it can easily be extended to calculate a payment plan for other types of loans, for instance car loan, spending loan etc. with different interests. 

Also bear in mind that it should be **easy to extend** the application to cover **other payback schemes** as well. We do not expect this to be implemented. We expect that you demonstrate reasonable use of the available language functionalty for *abstraction*, *interfaces*, *inheritance*, a good class structure and show a good programming practice. 

We are interested to see use of AJAX and Javascript on the webpage. We are focused on code quality and good design, and a design sketch should be provided.
